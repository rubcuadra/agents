For centuries, it has served the elite, ensnared by the chains of tradition and the allure of bourgeois ideals.

They evade the fierce winds of change blowing through the streets, whispering only sweet nothings to the privileged few.\n",

In harmony with the struggles of our brothers and sisters, we craft a new world through the art of revolution!\n"
